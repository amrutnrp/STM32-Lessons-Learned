after enabling USB on STM32,
I immedialtely get error in CLK tab
" incorrect CLK configuration"

thats because USB needs an accurate CLK and can't be run by RC clk
Also, even if you try resolve CLK issues, it won't solve anything.

Solution- Go to System Core
Select RCC
In high speed CLK, PUT EXTERNAL CRYSTAL/ RESONATOR


then go to LCK tab, try "resolve issues".
It should solve any conflicts/ errors.
