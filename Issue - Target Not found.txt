I removed the STLink while it was uploading the code
SO, maybe some data partition got corrupted
and I could not download the flash any longer
It was giving the following error

two pop ups, and at the end this at cmdline.
Internal command error Error: Flash Download failed - Target DLL has been cancelled

Solution-  make Boot0 high and upload once
make boot0 low
now the uploading should resume as before
